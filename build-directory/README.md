# GBA-SM
Wii homebrew to manage GBA saves using a GC link cable.

# Usage
Grab the release from the "releases" tab above and start up the dol on your Wii.
Make sure to plug in a GC Controller into Port 1 of your console and the GBA Link Cable into Port 2.  
Now Boot your GBA without a cart inserted, it should automatically boot into the dumper when connected. From there you can just follow the instructions on screen.  
If your GBA resets when you get to the step of inserting a cart, try to boot your GBA with the cart already inserted and holding down start+select on the GBA bootup, this aborts the game launch and should allow the dumper to boot up from there.
